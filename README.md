# Gradient Descent By Hand

This repo contains a demo implementing gradient descent from scratch, including the formulas to calculate the algorithm steps with pen and paper in parallel. Gradient descent is applied to a linear regression toy example. The optimal solution using normal equation is given for comparison with the iterative solution found by gradient descent.

## Dependencies

See `Pipfile` for an overview of required python packages.
